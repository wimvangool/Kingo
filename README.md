### Purpose, Principals & Scope
The **Kingo** framework is a set of **.NET Standard 2.0** libraries meant to speed up the development of **event-driven** (micro-)services in a Service-Oriented landscape. We attempt to achieve this by combining a set of design, implementation and testing principals with a set of libraries that are specifically designed to follow these principals. Consequently, if you choose to adopt and adhere to the design guidelines of the framework, we promise you the following results:

- A clear understanding on how MicroServices can be implemented in a way that is solid, structured, platform-agnostic and future-proof.

- A way to design and implement your MicroServices the same way over and over again, regardless of which platforms, frameworks or architectural patterns you wish to apply (ranging from CRUD to Domain-Driven Design and from CQRS to Event-Sourcing).

- A way to test your MicroServices using a layered approach, where each test-layer builds on its lower layers to integrate and test more components while re-using the lower layer's scenarios, so that your tests become just as clean and maintainable as your application-code.
