### Purpose, Principals & Scope
The **Kingo** framework is a set of **.NET Standard 2.0** libraries meant to speed up the development
of **event-driven** (micro-)services in a Service-Oriented landscape. We attempt to achieve this by
combining a set of design, implementation and testing principals with a set of libraries that are
specifically designed to follow these principals.

a [Getting started Guide](https://github.com/wimvangool/Kingo/wiki/Getting-Started) and some tutorials.
